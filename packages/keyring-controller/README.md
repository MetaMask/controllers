# `@metamask/keyring-controller`

Stores identities seen in the wallet and manages interactions such as signing.

## Installation

`yarn add @metamask/keyring-controller`

or

`npm install @metamask/keyring-controller`

## Lock timing diagnostics

Enable `DEBUG=metamask:keyring-controller*` to see lock timing
logs (using the same project/module logger setup as other controllers).

Each controller or vault mutex acquisition logs `Lock requested`, `Lock acquired`,
`Lock released`, and `Locked operation finished`, correlated by `id` and labeled
with the lock and operation names. Durations use a monotonic clock, in milliseconds:

- `waitMs`: time spent waiting to acquire the mutex.
- `holdMs`: time the mutex was actually held, including transaction setup,
  persistence, and any rollback.
- `totalMs`: time from requesting the mutex until the operation finishes.
- `success`: whether the operation completed without throwing.

Atomic keyrings run their operations outside the controller mutex. Separate
start/finish logs report their full `durationMs`, while `atomicUpdate` lock logs
measure only their controller-side commit windows. The keyring's own internal
lock wait/hold times are not observable by this controller. Unsafe read-only
operations do not acquire a mutex and do not produce lock timing logs.

Logs omit operation arguments, results, and errors to avoid exposing secrets.
